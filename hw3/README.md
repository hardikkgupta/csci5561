# Homework 3
```diff
- Note:
- I incurred a two point deduction due to the bi-directional matching in find_match. You should do the bi-directional matching.
- I incurred a two point deduction because np.linalg.lstsq(a, b) solves the linear system aA = b, but we are looking for Aa = b
- + 5 for attempting bonus question
- I incurred a three point deduction in 2D FT pair 3, because vertical edges correspond to many horizontal frequencies
