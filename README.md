# My work on CSCI 5561’s Computer Vision

## Introduction
The primary goal of this course is to introduce students to computer vision -- how to make computers make sense of images! Traditionally, computer vision has been studied in a bottom up fashion. At the lowest level, images are processed to obtain simple features (e.g. corners, edges). Then comes geometry in which these features are used to build 3D models of the environment. Next up is mid-level vision in which features are grouped into segments or other salient regions. At the highest level is the problem of object recognition which could be considered as a gateway to general intelligence. 

## Concepts
This list will numerate all the concepts learned in the course.
