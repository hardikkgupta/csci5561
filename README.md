# My work on CSCI 5561â€™s Computer Vision
The primary goal of this course is to introduce students to computer vision -- how to make computers make sense of images! Traditionally, computer vision has been studied in a bottom up fashion. At the lowest level, images are processed to obtain simple features (e.g. corners, edges). Then comes geometry in which these features are used to build 3D models of the environment. Next up is mid-level vision in which features are grouped into segments or other salient regions. At the highest level is the problem of object recognition which could be considered as a gateway to general intelligence. In the last decade, the field has been transforming at a mind boggling rate where learning based architectures have become increasingly dominant. It is impossible to cover all aspects of computer vision in depth in a single course. We will focus on fundamentals and let you explore state of the art methods through the course project  The course will be organized around three modules: Geometry, Image Features and Deep Learning. After taking this course, you will:
- Learn about basic tools and techniques for designing (and analyzing) computer vision algorithms and architectures
- Become familiar with active research challenges in vision
- Gain hands-on experience in building vision systems
